# Quick Start \[WIP\]

**TODO:**

* create account
* installation
* create service
* test service

In this document you will learn the basics of working with Code.Store platform. In order to build our first Code.Store Service we are going to go through the following steps:

* Create your Code.Store account
* Prepare your first Service either in the [Code.Store Console](quick-start-with-console.md) or locally, with the help of [Code.Store CLI](quick-start-with-cli.md)
* Configure the Endpoint
* Deploy the Service
* Generate your Code.Store Client
* Access your Service from the Code.Store Client

{% hint style="info" %}
There are two ways to manage your Service: [Code.Store Console](quick-start-with-console.md) and [Code.Store CLI. ](quick-start-with-cli.md)Both of them give you ability to perform the same actions with Code.Store Platform, so you can start with either of them and continue later with another.
