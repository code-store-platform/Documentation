# Our vision

### Reusability

We created code.store because we believe the way software is being built today is not adapted to pace of the modern world. We think that you should not spend time on problems that have been already solved in the past.

![From custom built monolith to software editor powered monoliths to re-usable API components](.gitbook/assets/image%20%281%29.png)

Modules, packages, DLLs, JARs, servlets, there have been always a desire for re-usability, but there were always a lot of barriers to reusability: technological stack, support & maintenance, integration, compatibility and size of each component. 

**So why it would be different with code.store ?**

In the past years the world of web-development saw several profound changes in the way we build software that make out code.store idea reasonable:

* **Headless and decoupled approaches**: with powerful and stable front-end frameworks like Angular, React and Vue, it is now easy to build truly decoupled applications. It is important, because the strongest barrier to re-usability is the front-end and UX. With decoupling we can focus on API reusability.
* **GraphQL**: it offers a lot of flexibility to frontend developers. Previously, each time an application needed a product listing presented in a slightly different way, we would either have to load all the unnecessary data from a single REST endpoint or ask backend developers to provide a new "lighter" endpoint.
* **Serverless is widely accepted**: you want to reuse live, running, supported and functional code. That means you accept that the module / service / lego brick you re-use might run somewhere and you do not really care if it handles traffic and provides good SLAs.
* **Microservices are mainstream**: when you reuse complete and functional "modules" you do microservices. Call them nano/micro/macro/mini services but your project is a patchwork of small, isolated and autonomous services glued together by your front-end application.

### Revenues

When independent developers, companies or digital agencies build software for others they usually bill time they spent on it. It's therefore complicated to re-use components from one project to another, and almost impossible to share funding, specifically when you mix hosting and support. We wanted to change that paradigm by providing a new way for billing projects. 

For each service on code.store, you may activate metered or monthly billing and sell them to your clients. We take care of retrieving funds, and take a small cut of only 10%. The recurring revenues cover your initial development time, hosting resources, our platform and the time you spent on support and maintenance of your service. 

Nowadays, « Every company is a tech company », but being a software editor is not easy. Initial technological stack, marketing, R&D investments, ROI roadmap management, indirect distribution are complex and inaccessible for most companies.

We bet that by providing a common platform and reducing the software to « bite » sized, running, live service, we’ll enable re-usability, sharing and, ultimately, billing trough direct sales or marketplace.

### Simplicity

There are  too many ways to create software today. We created code.store in a way that you can focus only on your code, while we take care of the rest \(some of the features in the list are still in the roadmap but we are working hard to delivery them to you as soon as possible\):

* containerisation
* database modelling and management
* security
* GDPR
* performance
* continuous integration and deployment
* automated tests
* monitoring
* H24 support
* instant re-use

code.store is a rather opinionated platform, which means we have made a certain number of choices for you in order to simplify the development. However, we want it to be a platform built by developers for developers, and we are open to suggestions and would be really happy to hear from you in our community chat [https://spectrum.chat/code-store](https://spectrum.chat/code-store) !
