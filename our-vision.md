  We created code.store with two strong ideas: code should be re-usable, like
  lego bricks and code should provide developers recurring revenues funding
  support and maintenance.

# Our vision

### Reusability

We created code.store because we believe the way software is being built today is not adapted to pace of the future world. We think that you should not spend time on problems that have been already solved in the past.  

![From custom built monolith to software editor powered monoliths to re-usable API components](.gitbook/assets/image%20%281%29.png)

Modules, packages, DLLs, JARs, servlets, there have been always a desire for re-usability, but there was always a lot of barriers to reusability : technological stack, support & maintenance, integration, compatibility and size of each component. 

**So why it would be different with code.store ?**

We have several profound changes in the way we build software that make out code.store dream reasonable : 

* **Headless and decoupled approaches** : with powerful and stable front-end frameworks like Angular, React and Vue, it's now easy to build decoupled applications. It's important, because the strongest barrier to re-usability is the front-end and UX. With decoupling we can focus on API reusability.
* **GraphQL** : it offers sufficient flexibility to avoid forks on the back-end. If, each time an application needs product listing presented in a slightly different way, we would need changes to the API, there will be no room for reusability.
* **Serverless is widely accepted** : you want to reuse live, running, supported and functional code. That means you accept that the module / service / lego brick you re-use might run somewhere and you do not really care if it handles traffic and provides good SLAs.
* **Microservices are mainstream** : When you re-use complete and functional "modules" you do microservices. Call them nano/micro/macro/mini services your project is a patchwork of small, isolated and autonomous services glued together by your front-end application.

### Revenues

When independent developers, companies or digital agencies build software for others they usually bill time they spent on it. It's therefore complicated to re-use components from one project to another, and almost impossible to share funding, specifically when you mix hosting and support. We wanted to change that paradigm by providing a new way for billing projects. 

For each service on code.store, you may activate metered or monthly billing and sell them to your clients. We take care of retrieving funds, and take a small cut of only 10%. The recurring revenues cover your initial development time, hosting ressources, our platform and the time you spent on support and maintenance of your service. 

« Every company is a tech company », but being a software editor is not easy. Initial technological stack, marketing, R&D investments, ROI roadmap management, indirect distribution are complex and inaccessible for most companies.

We bet that by providing a common platform and reducing the software to « bite » sized, running, live service, we’ll enable re-usability, sharing and, ultimately, billing trough direct sales or marketplace.

### Simplicity

There are  too many ways to create software today. We created code.store in a way that you can focus only on your code, while we take care of the rest : 

* containerization
* database modeling and management
* security
* GDPR
* performance
* continuous integration and deployment
* automated tests
* monitoring
* H24 support
* instant re-use

code.store is an opinionated platform, means we made a certain number of choices that may not suite you, but we think to cover majority of use cases where you would need isolated, scalable, re-usable microservices.
