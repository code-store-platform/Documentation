# Commands

To download and install CLI, [follow the instructions here](code-store-cli.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
You can invoke code.store CLI either by using the full **`codestore`** command, or by using the short version **`cs`**.
{% endhint %}

### Synopsis

To get a list of all commands, call `cs help`:

```bash
cs help
```

### Basic usage

{% hint style="info" %}
Most of the commands accept some specific arguments which can be provided while invoking the command in a long or short formats:

* Long format: **`cs command --argumentName argumentValue`**
* Short format: **`cs command -a argumentValue`**

Use **`cs help command`** to know more about the specific command and its arguments.
{% endhint %}

### Authentication

```bash
$ cs help auth
Authentication commands, login, logout, whoami

USAGE
  $ codestore auth:COMMAND

COMMANDS
  auth:login   Authenticate at code.store platform
  auth:logout  Clears user credentials and invalidates local session
  auth:whoami  Display the currently logged in user
```

To be able to use the CLI you have to login into your **code.store** account. To do that use the following command:

```bash
cs auth:login
```

`cs login` will try to authenticate through the browser \(it is going to open the default browser in your system\).

At any time you can check under which user you are being authenticated:

```bash
cs auth:whoami
```

In order to finish your session and logout use the following command:

```bash
cs auth:logout
```

You can also use short aliases of the above commands: `cs login`, `cs whoami` and `cs logout`.

It might be your e-commerce project or a logistics mobile application or business web-app. Each time you add a service to a project, we create a separate, isolated instance of your service. Each service reused in a project has its own environments, databases, logs, and billing
