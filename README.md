# What is code.store?

We started code.store from a simple idea : reuse and share live, hosted code among projects and organizations. We wanted to create a public marketplace of where every developer and company could sell their API first services on a subscription or pay-per-call rate-plan.

code.store is a back-end-as-service GraphQL, schemas first platform where you can build, host, re-use and bill microservices.

Think of it as a Netlify for re-usable GraphQL microservices, with a monetization engine.

**For the good of your company and the planet, we think that reusing code is really important!**
