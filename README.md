# Introduction

We started code.store from a simple idea : reuse and share live, hosted code among projects and organizations. 

While GitHUB and open source in general, solved the problem of code sharing, there was nothing to help companies to share running services, providing H24 support, discoverability and easiest possible way to manage services over time.

On code.store ou can : 

* Deploy and host any micros-service on a secure, multi-cloud environment, in any language
* Manage GraphQL schemas describing data that your services manipulate
* Your schemas are automatically hosted and managed, you don't have to think about CRUD operations, imports or exports
* We provide you with reliable auto-scaled storage
* Robust versioning and staging systems for your data and code
* Discover and reuse any service created by your organization
* Sell services as subscription or pay-as-you-go to your clients, using our API firs
* Earn code.points by creating services used in live projects and win iPhones and Macbooks !

For the good of your company and the planet, we think that reusing code is really important.
