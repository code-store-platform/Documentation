# What is code.store?

**code.store** started from a simple idea: the complexity of the modern world is astonishing and is increasing with every day, that's why we should be spending our time and energy on problems that are new and complex to solve and try and reuse everything else. That's why we decided to create a platform that companies and software engineers to reuse and share live, hosted code among projects and organizations. We also want to create a public marketplace where every developer and company could sell their API-first services on a subscription or pay-per-call rate-plan.

**code.store** is a backend-as-a-service, a GraphQL schema-first platform where you can build, host, reuse and bill your services.

Think of it as a Netlify for re-usable GraphQL microservices, with a monetization engine.

**For the good of your company and the planet, we think that reusing code is really important!**
