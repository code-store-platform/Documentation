# What is code.store?

## **Welcome!**

We are happy that you're here! ðŸ‘‹

So what is **code.store**? It all started from a simple idea: the complexity of the modern world is astonishing and is increasing with every day, that's why we should be spending our time and energy on problems that are new and complex to solve and try and reuse everything else. That's why we decided to create a platform for companies and software engineers to reuse and share live, hosted code among [projects](getting-started/core-concepts.md#project) and [organizations](getting-started/core-concepts.md#organization). We also want to create a public marketplace where every developer and company could sell their API-first [services](getting-started/core-concepts.md#service) on a subscription or pay-per-call rate-plan.

So, in short, **code.store** is a backend-as-a-service, a GraphQL schema-first platform where you can build, host, reuse and bill your [services](getting-started/core-concepts.md#service)  so that you could build some truly amazing products!

**For the good of your company and the planet, we think that reusing code is really important!**
