## 🏠 Where my services are hosted?

**code.store**  is cloud agnostic, meaning we can deploy **code.store** on any cloud provider or even on premises for advanced, enterprise clients. Our own infrastructure is hosted on AWS. Your services will be hosted on our AWS accounts. If you want, we can 

## 🦄 Who creates services?

You do it. Don't be lazy. Code. 😈

## 💰How do I monetize my services? 

There is no public marketplace yet. When you build new projects for your clients you can create some part of those [projects](core-concepts.md#project) as reusable [services](core-concepts.md#service). Then you can sell them to your clients with a subscription or pay-per-use rate plan. 

You can bundle in a single monthly rate everything : your initial build cost \(example: the 50 man-days used to build the service\), support and maintenance time \(example: the 5 man days you spend every month on this service\), hosting \(code.store costs\) and provision for new features \(example: yearly 20 man-days used to add new features to your service\). 

When you add a [service](core-concepts.md#service) in a [project](core-concepts.md#project), you can setup a different price for each of your [service-instances](core-concepts.md#service-instance). You can then invite your client to this [project](core-concepts.md#project), providing his billing details. We'll generate the invoice for each client and collect payements for you. Each month you'll receive your combined funds collected from all clients in a single payement from us. Money time !
