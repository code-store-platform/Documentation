# FAQ \[WIP\]

## Where my services are hosted?

**code.store**  is cloud agnostic, meaning we can deploy **code.store** on any cloud provider or even on premises for advanced, enterprise clients. Our own infrastructure is hosted on AWS. Your services will be hosted on our AWS accounts.

## Who creates services?

You do it. Don't be lazy. Code. ðŸ˜ˆ

## How do I monetize my services?

There is no public marketplace yet. When you build new projects for your clients you can create some part of those [projects](core-concepts.md#project) as reusable [services](core-concepts.md#service). Then you can sell them to your clients with a subscription or pay-per-use rate plan. You can bundle in a single monthly rate everything : your initial build cost \(example: the 50 man-days used to build the service\), support and maintenance time \(example: the 5 man days you spend every month on this service\), hosting \(code.store costs\) and provision for new features \(example: yearly 20 man-days used to add new features to your service\). When you add a [service](core-concepts.md#service) in a [project](core-concepts.md#project), you can setup a different price for each of your [service-instances](core-concepts.md#service-instance).
