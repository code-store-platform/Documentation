# Quick Start with CLI \[WIP\]

This guide will introduce some basic code.store concepts like services and schema generation using CLI. The goal of this quick start is to get you up and running fast, so lets not waste any time and start!ðŸš€ 

### Create code.store account

If you haven't done this already, then click on this link.

### Install the code.store CLI

We invite you to follow this guide and install our command line interface:

{% page-ref page="../../cli/code-store-cli.md" %}

### Authenticate and create service

Once you have your account and the CLI is installed, we can finally do some interesting stuff!

In order to work with the CLI, you have to connect it with your account by launching the following command:

```bash
cs auth:login
```

This command is going to launch your default browser and ask for your login details. Once you are authenticated, we can go on and create a new service.

```bash
cs service:create
```

You can check the contents of your new service directory by running `ls -lh ./` Lets take a couple of minutes and study the contents of the directory closer:

* package.json â€“ it is a standard NPM configuration file. Feel free and add any NPM packages you like, we are going to install them for you during the deployment of the service;
* codestore.yaml â€“ contains your service ID and will contain more configuration options in later versions;
* src â€“ this is where all of the source code lives
  * schema.graphql â€“ one of the most \(if not _the_ most\) important files. It contains a GraphQL schema of your service;
  * models â€“ contains generated TypeORM entities;
  * resolvers â€“ contains resolvers that define how the data is returned as well as some additional business logic.

### Describe your data model

### 4. Add business logic

### 5. Write tests

### 6. Deployment to Code.Store.Cloud

### 7. Generate a Client and access your Service
