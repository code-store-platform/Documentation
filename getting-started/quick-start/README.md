The goal of this section is to get you up to speed real fast. We are going to learn how to install and use the command line tools of code.store, how to create an account and write a basic service! Let's continue ðŸš€

There are two ways to manage your Service: [code.store Console](quick-start-with-web-interface.md) and [code.store CLI. ](quick-start-with-cli.md)Both of them give you ability to perform the same actions with code.store, so you can start with either of them and continue later with another.
