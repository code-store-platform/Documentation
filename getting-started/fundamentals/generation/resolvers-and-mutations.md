# Resolvers

## Overview

code.store platform support [file based resolvers](../services/graphql.md). To avoid manual file creation allowed a command `cs generate:resolver`, which generate an empty resolver for your `query` or `mutation` which specified in `schema.graphql` file in src directory.

To generate resolver execute `cs generate:resolver` CLI command, select resolver type: mutation or query and and specify a name:

```text
> cs generate:resolver

? Select the type of resolver (Use arrow keys)
❯ query 
  mutation  
  
? Enter the name of your resolver hello
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Also, you can use flags:

**-t** resolver type, one of: 'query' or 'mutation'

**-n** resolver name

**-f** force overwrite file if it already exists

For example, here a command from previous example: cs generate:resolver -t query -n hello
{% endhint %}

After command execution will be generated file `get.hello.ts` in `src/rest` directory:

```text
/**
 * This resolver was generated by code.store CLI.

import { Resolver } from 'codestore-utils';

const resolver: Resolver = async (parent, args, context, info) => {
  // Your code goes here.
  // Example of how to initialize an Entity:
  //   const exampleEntity = context.db.connection.getRepository(exampleEntity);
  //   exampleEntity.find();
  return 'Hello, World!';
}

export default resolver;
```

More information about resolver method and his params can be found in [GraphQL](../services/graphql.md) section.
