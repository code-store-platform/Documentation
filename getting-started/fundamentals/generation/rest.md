# REST

## Overview

code.store platform support [file based REST](../services/rest.md) endpoints. To avoid manual file creation allowed a command `cs generate:rest`, which generate an empty route template with handler method.

To generate REST route just execute `cs generate:rest` CLI command, select one of HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE and specify a new route name

```text
> cs generate:rest

? Select HTTP method (Use arrow keys)
❯ GET 
  POST 
  PUT 
  DELETE 
  
? Select HTTP method GET

? Name of your REST endpoint hello
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Also, you can use flags:

**-m** for method specification \(GET, POST, PUT, DELETE\)

**-n** for route name

For example, here a command from previous example: cs generate:rest -m get -n hello
{% endhint %}

After command execution will be generated file `get.hello.ts` in `src/rest` directory:

```text
/**
 * This handler was generated by code.store CLI.

import { Handler } from 'codestore-utils';

const handler: Handler = async (event, context) => {
  // your code goes here
  return 'Hello, world!';
}

export default handler;
```

More information about handler method and his params can be found in [REST](../services/rest.md) section.
